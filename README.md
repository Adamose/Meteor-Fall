# Meteor-Fall

Space Invaders but with a twist, defend the earth from a endless fall of meteors. Destroy all meteors before they touch the earth and make sure to not let one hit your spaceship.

# Origins

This is the second program I ever made. It was made in 2018 when I was in the 10th grade and had just learnt Java for about 4 months. The idea behind making this game was that my friend wanted to learn Java after I showed him my Flappy Bird clone so I taught him the basics by showing him how I made this game. To this day this remains one of my favourite things I have programmed.

# Gameplay

The game normally runs at 60FPS but looks choppy in this gif to save space.
